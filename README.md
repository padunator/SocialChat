# Bachelor - Socialization application for analizing the concept of "Sociability by design" 

This is an application built using Angular, Express, Socket.io, Mongoose, Sentiment and many other frameworks for the purpose of analyzing the general behaviour of users in regards of socialization in virtual environments.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.


## Development client


Run `ng serve` for running the client application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development server
Run `node server` to start the server! The server has to be reloaded in case of any modifications - nodemon is currently not activated! 


## References for this implementation are as follows: 
1. Backend: https://github.com/harsh5692/quiz-time
2. Frontend: https://github.com/wesdoyle/base-chat (Just the HTMLs of the Chatroom part)

It has to be explicitly stated that the code in the projects stated above was just used for orientative reasons! NO integral parts or fragments have been copied - just a few lines have been used which have also been modified to the actual needs of the underlying implementation! 
For the frontend, only the general structure for the chat-room html-templates was used for orientative reasons. This is emphasized by the fact that the complete structure, look, behaviour and especially the logic of this underlying project is completely different to the references!
